Project Title: Simple Pokemon

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION - 
This program is simply a Pokémon game based on the hit series Pokémon.
In this game, you play as Ash Ketchum using his Pokémon team to battle the Elite Four. 
The program starts by asking the player if they are ready to battle and if they are, will start the battle. 
The battle consists of the player choosing a Pokémon from Ash’s team and the 
program prompting them if they would like to switch Pokémon or attack the opponent. 
After you attack the opponent, the opponent will attack back. 
The opponent uses random numbers to pick a Pokémon to battle and a random number to choose the move. 
This repeats until you (Ash) loses or you defeat the Elite Four. 
The program will then output the team you won with and all the Pokémon you’ve defeated.
The program end when you press ENTER.

PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION - 
How to run the program:
Follow the input prompts. If the program asks for "[A]ttack or [S]witch", input whatever is in the brackets.
Input the pokemon name correctly when the program asks for it.

The program only breaks if you input "c" the first time the program asks "Are You Ready to Battle?!".
This is because "c" was implemented to make debugging quicker.

How to use "c":
The first time the program asks "Are You Ready to Battle?!", inputting c then a number 1 through 5 will
fast forward you to the leader's number. This will not add to the output file where it displays the
number of Pokemon defeated.

REFELECTIONS - 
I learned a lot about C++ while working on this project. I learned that you shouldn't do a Pokemon game because it
is very difficult. However, I learned more about classes and better implementation of them. What I would do differently
is to outline the classes and what the classes so before hand. Basically a UML class diagram. I also learned that you 
should keep better track of what variables are in which class. Most of my time was spent navigating through class files.
